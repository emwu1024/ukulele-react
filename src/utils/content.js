    title: "What is a Ukulele?",
    content: `The ukulele is a 4 stringed instrument commonly made with a wooden body. 
    It is apart of the lute family of instruments and comes in many sizes. The ukulele has a rich history with origins from when Portuguese workers 
    from Madeira and Azores immigrated to Hawaii in the 1880s and brought over the machete, cavaquinho, timple, and raj√£o.`,

    title: "How do I tune a Ukulele?",
    content: `There are 4 pegs on the headstock (top) of the ukulele. Turning each of the pegs will tighten or loosen the string resulting in a higher or lower sound respectively.
    For standard tuning the ukulele should be tuned to GCEA with G being the lowest and A being the highest. Online tuners and app tuners such as GuitarTuna can help with tuning,
    You can also buy a physical chromatic tuner.`,

    title: "What are the different types of Ukulele?",
    content: `    Soprano Ukulele: The soprano ukulele is the smallest and most common type of ukulele. It typically has 12-15 frets and a scale length of around 13 inches (33 cm). Soprano ukuleles produce a bright and classic ukulele sound.

    Concert Ukulele: The concert ukulele is slightly larger than the soprano and has a fuller sound. It usually has 15-20 frets and a scale length of around 15 inches (38 cm). Concert ukuleles are popular among players who want a slightly larger instrument but still maintain the traditional ukulele sound.

    Tenor Ukulele: The tenor ukulele is larger than the soprano and concert ukuleles, providing more volume and a deeper tone. It typically has 17-19 frets and a scale length of around 17 inches (43 cm). Tenor ukuleles are favored by professional musicians and those who prefer a richer, more robust sound.

    Baritone Ukulele: The baritone ukulele is the largest of the traditional ukulele sizes. It has a longer scale length of around 19 inches (48 cm) and usually has 18-21 frets. The baritone ukulele is tuned differently from the other sizes, usually to D-G-B-E, similar to the highest four strings of a guitar. It produces a deeper, more guitar-like sound.

    Other Variations: In addition to the standard sizes mentioned above, there are also less common variations of the ukulele, such as the sopranissimo (smallest), bass (largest), and sopranino (smaller than the soprano). These variations offer unique playing experiences and tonal qualities.`,
