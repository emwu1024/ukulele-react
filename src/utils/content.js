    content: `Evelyn Quan Wang is a middle-aged Chinese American immigrant who runs a laundromat with her husband, Waymond; two decades earlier, they eloped to the United States and had a daughter, Joy.
  
      In the present day, the laundromat is being audited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); Waymond is trying to serve Evelyn divorce papers in an attempt to get her attention so they can talk about their marriage; Evelyn's stern and demanding father (referred to as Gong Gong, Cantonese for 'maternal grandfather'[15]) is visiting for her Chinese New Year party; and Joy is dealing with depression[16] and has a strained relationship with her mother, which also includes Evelyn's reluctance to accept that Joy is a lesbian as well as Joy's relationship with her non-Chinese girlfriend Becky. `,
